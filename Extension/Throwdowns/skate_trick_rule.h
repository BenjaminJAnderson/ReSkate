// S.K.A.T.E. with no repeated tricks: a trick that was already set in this game does not
// count as a set. The setter's landed attempt is turned into a missed set, which the
// game shows as a failed set, and the round rule then passes the set to the next player.
//
// ServerSkateThrowdown's attempt handler (graph 0xc4a37359) finds the setter with one
// ArrayIndexOf (pc 0x60c), after copying the attempt's WasSuccessful into local L811 and
// its trick record into L378, and before branching on L811 (pc 0x690). That one call is
// pointed at a wrapper that compares the record with the tricks already set in the event
// and clears L811 for a repeat. Every machine's server runs the handler for every attempt,
// its own and the relayed ones, in the same order, so every machine keeps the same
// history and reaches the same outcome.
